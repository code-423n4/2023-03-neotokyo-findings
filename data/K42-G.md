## Scope = BYTES2.sol (Resubmit to gas optimizations section)

Instead of using the revert statement, it's better to use the require statement to ensure that the condition is met before proceeding with the contract call, not required change, as no loss of functionality, but suggested.
I also changed how the balance is checked for slightly better gas optimization.

## Example improvement 1 ## 
function upgradeBytes(uint256 _amount) external {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(BYTES1).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(balance >= _amount, "DoNotHaveEnoughOldBytes");
    // Burn the original BYTES 1.0 tokens and mint replacement BYTES 2.0.
    IByteContract(BYTES1).burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    _mint(msg.sender, _amount);
    // Emit the upgrade event.
    emit BytesUpgraded(msg.sender, _amount);
}
