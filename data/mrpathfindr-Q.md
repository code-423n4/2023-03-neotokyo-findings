Compiler version too recent 
--

`pragma solidity ^0.8.19;`

The compiler version detected in the code is too recent. Therefore, it is not time-tested and may be susceptible to multiple bugs and vulnerabilities, both from the usage and security perspectives.

Mitigation: Make use of a more stable version of solidity. 

The Use of Pragma can be problematic 
--

`^0.8.19;`

The contract was found to be using a floating pragma which is not considered safe as it can be compiled with all the versions described.
The following affected files were found to be using floating pragma:

Making use of 'require' instead of 'revert' 
--

The require Solidity function guarantees the validity of the condition(s) passed as a parameter that cannot be detected before execution. It checks inputs, contract state variables, and return values from calls to external contracts.


Using `require` instead of `revert` improves the overall readability of the contract code.


The construction `if (condition) { revert(); }` is equivalent to `require(!condition);`

The Use of Inline Assembly 
--
Inline assembly is a way to access the Ethereum Virtual Machine at a low level. This bypasses several important safety features and checks of Solidity. 


May not be necessary in code such as 

`  assembly {
            amount := calldataload(0x24)
        }
`

Multiple vulnerabilities have been detected previously when the assembly is not properly used within the Solidity code; therefore, caution should be exercised while using them.
